    <h2>What is Linux?</h2>

    <p>
      Linux is actually the kernal of a full operating system 
      the full name being GNU/Linux. For simplicities sake, people 
      just call it Linux. When looking into the Linux operating system, 
      you may hear many different names of "distributions", some expamples being Ubuntu, Arch, 
      Debian, Pop! OS, Linux Mint, and many more. These are all different versions of Linux 
      as a whole. Each one is a twist on the same operating system. As a whole, 
      much of Linux is similar between these different "twists". People use Linux for 
      its customization and it being open source. Open source means that many of the programs 
      that you will run into while using the operating system (and the operating system itself) 
      are free to use, change, or anything else your heart desires. This does not mean all programs, 
      but a majority of the popular programs within Linux are open source. Another reason why many people 
      and companies use Linux is because of its security. Because so many people look at the code whenever a 
      new update comes out, because of its open source nature, many bugs and security holes are fixed before 
      people with bad intentions are able to find loopholes in the code. Due to a small market share, many popular 
      programs have not come to Linux yet. In the future, that may change as popularity is growing slowly.
