    <h2>What is Mac OS?</h2>

    <p>
      Mac OS is an operating system developed and exclusively used by Apple inc. 
      It is very popular within school systems, with programmers, and with creatives. 
      It has gained popularity due to it being the main alternative to Windows and 
      its ease of use, for people that have used it for years. There are many benefits 
      to Mac OS, but security and lack of bloat (useless programs pre-installed on computer) are things many 
      people mention when they speak of Mac OS.
