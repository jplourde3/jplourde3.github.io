    <h2>What is Windows?</h2>

    <p>
      The Windows operating system hardly needs an introduction at this point. 
      Unless you are on a mobile device, chances are, you are using a Windows computer. 
      Windows was created by the Microsoft Corporation and is now the most popular 
      operating system by a large margin. Because of the ubiquity of the operating system 
      most programs are on Windows. Windows is used by most businesses across the world 
      as well, because of the amount of programs available on the operating system. Windows 
      is the standard when it comes to operating systems. If you were to walk into a store today 
      looking for a computer, your choices would include a couple different Mac OS computers and 
      dozens of Windows computers made by many different companies in many different price ranges.
