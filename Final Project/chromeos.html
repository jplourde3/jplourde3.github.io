    <h2>What is Chrome OS?</h2>

    <p>
      Chrome OS is a lightweight operating system created by 
      Google to be a simple way for people to access the internet. 
      The thought process behind this is that the average consumer 
      along with students in school do not need local programs and 
      computing, because most things can be done on the web. For the 
      most part, Google is correct. A Chromebook would be more than 
      enough for a large majority of consumers.
