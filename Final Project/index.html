    <h2>What is a Desktop Operating System</h2>

    <p>
      A desktop operating system is the underpinning of any modern laptop 
      or desktop computer. It controls what programs you can run, how 
      they run, and even what hardware you can use in conjunction with 
      your computer. This leads people to ask, <em>"Why is there more than one 
      operating system?"</em> The reason there are multiple is because each 
      has their own benefits and downsides. This website has been created to 
      provide an introduction to each operating system along with some of 
      their pros and cons.

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Windows</th>
        <td>
          Windows was created by the Microsoft Corporation to provide a universal
          operating system that could be licensed by computer manufacturers and 
          used on many different types of machines. Today it has continued down 
          this path and is the most popular desktop operating system by a large 
          margin.
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <th>Mac OS</th>
        <td>
          Mac OS was created by Apple Inc. as a successor to their previous operating 
          systems. It is unique as it is only available on laptops and desktops 
          made by Apple. Because of this the hardware and operating system run very
          smoothly together creating a symbiotic relationship.
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <th>Linux</th>
        <td>
          Linux, also known as GNU/Linux is an open source operating system that has 
          gained much ground recently in the server space of computing. It is unique 
          because it is infinitely customizable. Because of this, there are thousands 
          of different distributions of Linux that can be downloaded, most of them for 
          free. Unlike the previous two operating systems, it is uncommon to find any 
          version of Linux available on a computer that one would purchase online or 
          in a store. However, if one is found, it will most likely run Ubuntu or Pop! OS,
          which are both different distributions of Linux.
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <th>Chrome OS</th>
        <td>
          Chrome OS is a spin-off of Linux made by Google. Chrome OS is a very lightweight 
          operating system that can run on much less powerful hardware than Windows or OSX. 
          The main selling point of Chrome OS is its no frills nature of being an operating 
          system with one purpose, to browse the internet using Chrome (a web browser). Since 
          this point, Chrome OS has added the ability to run Android applications as well as 
          switch to a more traditional Linux desktop, which has the ability to download Linux 
          applications.
